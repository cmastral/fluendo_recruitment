        "# **Solution Overview: Team Detection and Classification**\n",
        "This solution is a high-level overview of the steps involved in building a system for detecting and classifying players in football images based on their teams, in two stages: detection and classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Dataset Preparation**\n",
        "The first step is to collect a dataset consisted of annotated images with annotations of the players, without the need for team labels. This dataset will be used specifically for training the object detection model to identify the regions of interest (i.e., players) in the images. This annotated dataset will be used for training and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of player classification, the dataset typically consists of cropped images of individual players rather than full football scene images. Each player image should be labeled with their corresponding team label.\n",
        "\n",
        "To evaluate the models, the dataset should be divided into training, validation and testing sets. The train_test_split function from scikit-learn is used twice. First to split to train and test and then split train again into validation and train, with the majority of the data allocated for training and smaller subsets for validation and testing. This ensures that the models wil be evaluated on unseen data and will help estimate their performance on new images.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Object Detection**\n",
        "Object detection is used to locate and localize the players in the images. In this solution, we can use a pre-trained object detection model. The specific model architecture can be chosen based on the requirements. Some choices for this case could be YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Player Classification**\n",
        "Once the players are detected, the next step is to classify them based on their team. This can be achieved using a player classification method. We can train a separate model that takes the cropped player images as input and predicts the team labels. Common architectures for player classification include pre-trained CNN models such as VGG or ResNet.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Model Development**\n",
        "The object detection model and player classification model are trained separately. Training involves giving the labeled training data to the models, optimizing their parameters using suitable loss functions, and updating the model weights through backpropagation.\n",
        "\n",
        "After training, the models can be evaluated on the testing set to assess their performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to measure the models' ability in detecting and classifying players based on their teams.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the models are trained and evaluated, they can be used for inference on new, unseen images."
