        "# **Solution Overview: Team Detection and Classification with YOLOv4**\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to provide sample code and a proposal running for a team detection and classification system that can distinguish among players of different teams in a given image or video. The solution aims to automatically identify and locate players on the field and assign the appropriate team labels to each player.\n",
        "\n",
        "YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm that directly predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single pass through the network. It is a one stage object detector that divides the input image into a grid and applies convolutional layers to simultaneously predict bounding boxes and their associated class probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        " ## **Dataset Preparation**\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to use the YOLO algorithm for this problem, we would need to prepare the dataset in a specific format suitable for YOLO's training requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "YOLO requires a specific label format and annotations of the images. We can annotate the training images by drawing bounding boxes around the players and labeling them with their corresponding team classes (for example, Team 1 and Team 2), by using annotation tools like LabelImg. The annotations should be saved in a format that includes the bounding box coordinates and class labels for each player, as *.txt file per image (if no objects in image, no *.txt file is required).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the annotated dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets. Typically, a common split is around 70-80% for training, 10-15% for validation, and the remaining portion for testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Organize Directories and Configuration Files**\n",
        "\n",
        "This step involves properly configuring the custom .cfg, obj.data, obj.names, train.txt and test.txt files necessary for YOLO. These files are customized based on the problem, the dataset and based on specific requirements.  Additional information and comments within the implementation code provide  details on the customization.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Model Development**\n",
        "\n",
        "The YOLOv4 architecture is utilized for team detection and classification. Pre-trained weights for the convolutional layers are downloaded, enhancing the accuracy of the custom object detector without requiring extensive training.\n",
        "\n",
        "The network is trained using the annotated dataset and the customized YOLOv4 configuration file. The training is performed using the Darknet framework, optimizing the model parameters to minimize the classification error. The training progress, including loss and accuracy, can be visualized using the chart.png file.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Inference and Deployment**\n",
        "The Mean Average Precision (mAP) of the trained model is computed to assess its performance on the test set. The yolov4-obj_best.weights file, representing the best-performing weights achieved during training, is used for the evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The output predictions, including bounding boxes and class labels, can be displayed or saved for further analysis or visualization. The IoU, mAP, precision, and recall metrics provide a quantitative assessment of the model's performance in accurately detecting and classifying teams and players.\n"
