# Question 2

## 1. Which algorithms would you use to achieve this? Please provide at least 2 proposals

To achieve accurate team detection and classification, we can consider both traditional and modern deep learning techniques. Although deep learning approaches have proven their superiority in similar problems, it is also interesting to find out how a traditional computer vision approach performs in a situation like this.

A traditional approach could be utilizing Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm that can extract relevant features from images to represent the shape and appearance of players. HOG works by computing the gradients of image patches and creating histograms of gradient orientations. After extracting the HOG features, we can train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between different teams. Training the SVM with labeled examples of players from different teams will allow it to classify new instances into their respective teams.

For a deep learning approach, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective and can be utilized for problems like detection and classification. CNNs can automatically learn relevant features from images and can be trained using a labeled dataset of images containing players from different teams. The CNN will learn to recognize distinctive patterns and features specific to each team (like colors), enabling accurate classification.

In this case, we can use YOLO, a real-time object detection algorithm that directly predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single pass through the network. Itâ€™s a one stage object detector that divides the input image into a grid and applies convolutional layers to simultaneously predict bounding boxes and their associated class probabilities. YOLO can be trained on a dataset with labeled images of players from different teams, detect and classify players in real-time. The speed and efficiency of YOLO makes it suitable for real-time applications like sports.

# 2. Which potential bottlenecks may this problem encounter? (i.e. non-static camera). Just list them (if any)

When dealing with team detection and classification non-static cameras can introduce motion blur and distortions affecting the quality of the captured images, making it challenging to accurately detect players. Depending on the cameras and the distance from the field, the scale and perspective of players can vary significantly, affecting the accuracy of the prediction and introducing challenges in feature extraction.

Also, in team sports like soccer, players often block each other and they partially obstruct the view of other players. Occlusion can make it difficult to detect and classify players accurately. So, depending on the level of occlusion, the algorithm may struggle to distinguish between players from different teams.

Changes in lighting and weather conditions, or day and night games, can affect the appearance of players, due to shadows and variations in brightness and can impact the performance of algorithms that rely on color or texture information. Adapting to different lighting conditions and maintaining consistent performance can be a challenge.

It is also important to collect a diverse and representative dataset of players. This can be an extremely time-consuming process, however insufficient training data or an imbalanced dataset may result in reduced performance and difficulties in accurately classifying players.

# 3. Could your proposals be scaled to other team-based sports? (i.e. hockey, rugby, ...) Which would be worst-case scenarios?

The proposals mentioned can be scaled to other team-based sports such as hockey, rugby, basketball, or any other sport where team detection and classification are required and can serve as a starting point for training models in other sports. Due to the variations and challenges specific to each sport, the general principles can be adapted and applied. Depending on the sport, the challenges involve higher levels of occlusion, rapid motion, specific  lighting conditions, and complex backgrounds. 

To apply and scale these proposals to other sports, we would need to include an annotated dataset specific to the target sport, that covers various scenarios and player appearances in the specific sport.

Additionally, fine-tuning and retraining the models with new data would be necessary. This process involves adjusting the input data, class labels, and potentially modifying the architecture or parameters of the models to better suit the characteristics of the target sport.


# 4. Extra: provide a sample code with some proposal running

To tackle the problem of player detection and classification in football I considered 2 approaches.

In the first approach, I have chosen to utilize the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. YOLO is a one-stage object detection algorithm, which can simultaneously detect and classify objects within an image, including players and their teams. YOLO allows faster processing compared to other object detection algorithms. It performs detection in a single pass over the image, making it well-suited for real-time applications or scenarios where speed is crucial. Also, both detection and classification are combined into a single step. This can be beneficial for situations where both detection and classification need to be performed together.

In the second approach, I propose a more abstract and high-level solution using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by dividing the problem into separate tasks: player detection and player classification.

By implementing a dedicated player detection stage, we can accurately localize the players within the football images, which is crucial and can improve overall accuracy. The two-stage approach allows us to choose different models and architectures for player detection and classification independently. We can select the most appropriate models that suit the task and optimize each stage separately.

In this approach, I used TensorFlow and Keras, which are popular deep learning frameworks, to implement the proposed solutions, because they provide tools, pre-trained models, and utilities for both object detection and image classification tasks.

The choice between these approaches depends on the specific requirements of the project, the desired trade-offs between speed and accuracy, and the level of flexibility needed for the task.

*NOTE: I have conducted the implementation of my proposed approaches, along with detailed comments and analysis, using Google Colab notebooks.
